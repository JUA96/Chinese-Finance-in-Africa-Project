The impact of Chinese lending on state and firm level governance across Africa

Using a manually coded dataset with 1000 observations, I measured the impact of Chinese non-concessional loans on corruption and governance standards across 35 African states between 2006 and 2016. 

To analyse the non-linear relationship i programmed several GAMs in R. I also feature-engineered several variables that captured the whether a state had received both multilateral loans and Chinese loans in a given year.
